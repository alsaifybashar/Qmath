## 📚 Exam Archive Feature

The exam archive mimics the design and functionality of liutentor.se, allowing students to search for and download old exams.

### For Students

1. Navigate to `/archive` or click "Old Exams" in the header
2. Search by course code (e.g., "SF1672", "TATA24")
3. Browse results with exam date, type, and solution indicator
4. Click download (login required)

### For Admins

1. Log in with admin credentials
2. Navigate to `/admin/upload-exam`
3. Fill out exam metadata:
   - Course code (e.g., SF1672)
   - Course name (e.g., Linear Algebra)
   - Exam date
   - Exam type (Final, Midterm, Retake)
   - Has solution (checkbox)
4. Upload PDF file
5. Exam appears in search results immediately

### How It Works

- **Public search**: `/api/exams/search?q={courseCode}`
- **Protected download**: `/api/exams/download/{id}` (requires auth)
- **File storage**: PDFs stored in `/uploads/exams/{courseCode}/`
- **Login modal**: Prompts unauthenticated users to sign in

## 🧠 Adaptive Learning Engine

Qmath uses three complementary algorithms:

### 1. Item Response Theory (IRT)
- Estimates student ability (θ)
- Selects questions at optimal difficulty
- 3-Parameter Logistic (3PL) model

### 2. Bayesian Knowledge Tracing (BKT)
- Tracks mastery probability per topic: P(Learned)
- Updates after each attempt using Bayes' theorem
- Mastery threshold: P(L) > 0.95

### 3. Spaced Repetition (SM-2/FSRS)
- Schedules reviews for long-term retention
- Interval expansion on success
- Interval reset on forgetting

> For detailed formulas and implementation, see [`ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_LOGIC.md`](./ADAPTIVE_ENGINE_LOGIC.md)

## 🔒 Security

### Authentication & Authorization
- ✅ Passwords hashed with bcryptjs (10 rounds)
- ✅ HTTP-only session cookies
- ✅ JWT-based session management with NextAuth v5
- ✅ Role-based access control (admin vs student)
- ✅ Session validation on every admin route

### Route Protection
- ✅ Protected routes via middleware
- ✅ Admin panel routes require `role: 'admin'` in session
- ✅ Automatic redirect for unauthorized access
- ✅ Cannot delete own admin account (self-protection)

### Data Protection
- ✅ Exam PDFs served via authenticated API (not publicly accessible)
- ✅ File uploads validated (PDF only, size limits)
- ✅ SQL injection protection via Drizzle ORM
- ✅ CSRF protection via NextAuth
- ✅ User emails stored with unique constraints

### Admin Panel Security
- ✅ All admin actions require authentication check
- ✅ Confirmation dialogs for destructive actions (delete user, delete exam)
- ✅ Activity logging for audit trail
- ✅ IP address tracking for security events
